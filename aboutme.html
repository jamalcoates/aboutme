        <b>About Me:</b>
        <br>I am an artist by nature. I believe everyone is. I believe everyone has the urge to create or at least recreate and express themselves whether it be painting, music, decorating and designing.<br> 
        Since I was 3 years old I have been drawing or doodling to the point where it got me detention for not doing work but drawing instead. I began to focus on sports and music as I grew and put art on the back burner until I was approached by an old classmate who wanted a logo designed for her company. I didn't know how to use Adobe Illustrator but I got the job done and it was a success. Now I am a full time student to learn graphic design so i can show the world my creations.
